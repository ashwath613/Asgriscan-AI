# Asgriscan-AI
AI-powered emergency response and hospital preparedness system

1. Introduction
Asgriscan AI is an intelligent emergency response system designed to improve ambulance dispatch efficiency, optimize travel routes, and ensure early hospital preparedness using real-time data and artificial intelligence.

The system focuses on reducing human dependency in emergency coordination by automating decision-making processes, thereby minimizing response delays and improving patient outcomes.

2. Problem Statement
Conventional emergency response systems rely heavily on manual communication and human decision-making. This often leads to:
Delays in ambulance dispatch
Inefficient route selection
Lack of real-time coordination between ambulances and hospitals
Inadequate hospital preparedness before patient arrival
High risk of data inaccuracies
These limitations significantly affect response time and the overall quality of emergency healthcare services.

3. Proposed Solution
Asgriscan AI addresses these challenges through a fully automated and data-driven approach. The system integrates real-time GPS data, traffic information, and AI-based decision logic to:
Automatically dispatch emergency vehicles
Predict and optimize the fastest routes
Continuously synchronize ambulance and hospital systems
Alert hospitals in advance with estimated arrival times and patient data

This results in faster response times, better resource allocation, and improved emergency care readiness.

4. System Overview
The Asgriscan AI system consists of the following major components:
Frontend Interface
Provides dashboards for ambulance operators and hospital staff to monitor live status, routes, and alerts.
Backend Processing Unit
Handles AI computations, route optimization logic, and system synchronization.
AI and Data Intelligence Module
Analyzes real-time inputs such as GPS location, traffic conditions, and historical response data.
Hospital Notification System
Automatically alerts hospitals and prepares them before patient arrival.

5. Key Features
Automated emergency vehicle dispatch
AI-based route optimization with real-time updates
Low system latency enabling real-time synchronization
Early hospital notification and preparedness assessment
High data accuracy using reliable GPS and sensor inputs

Simple and user-friendly interface for operators

6. Technology Stack
